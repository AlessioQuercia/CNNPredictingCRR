# ProgettoBioInfo

In this project we use different Convolutional Neural Network models to perform classification in order to predict Cis-Regulatory Elements, given DNA sequences.
Several tests have been made using 16 models variations on 5 tasks belonging to 4 different cell lines. 
From the results of these tests we conclude that performing a multi-class classification is possible, but the accuracy is barely acceptable; whereas implementing a binary classification, predicting whether a DNA sequence is a Cis-Regulatory Element or another one leads to much better results.
